    <!-- SCIPIO: Demo Catalog (SEO) Alternative Url [Generated]
        The ALTERNATIVE_URL ProductCategoryContent and ProductContent records for Shop
        will now be generated using the new SEO generateWebsiteAlternativeUrls/generateAllAlternativeUrls services
        from their respective product and category names, based on the SEO configuration
        (/applications/product/config/SeoConfig.xml). 
        These SEO services exploit the generic ALTERNATIVE_URL construct and produce URL parts very similar to the old
        manually-written ones, but automatically.
        
        This will completely replace the legacy manually-written names from DemoCatalogAltUrlLegacyData.xml,
        which should no longer be included in ofbiz_component.xml.
        
        DEV NOTES:
        * The export is configured in seo-urls.properties and the file regenerated
          using the exportWebsiteAlternativeUrlsEntityXmlFileFromConfig service.
        * Initial data create (should no longer be needed after this file is populated once): 
          When no ALTERNATIVE_URLs in system, initial data can be generated using 
          generateAllAlternativeUrls, with these parameters:
          * genFixedIds = true
          * catFixedIdPat = ${groovy:idTrim.startsWith("CATALOG1_")?"CAT1_"+idTrim.substring(9):idTrim}-ALT${localeStrUp}
          * (rest: defaults)
        
        NOTE: Any conflicting names as a result of the generation should be fixed by modifying the source data 
            (product/category names and SeoConfig.xml settings) rather than creating any manual fixup records. 
        NOTE: The "generated-data" comment on the next line must not be modified! It is used as a template marker. -->
