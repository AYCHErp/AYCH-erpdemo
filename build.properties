# SCIPIO: Shared project build properties
#
# This file is read at the beginning of build.xml, and is NOT ignored by version control (git).
# You can specify project properties here to share between all developers/users of your project.
# 
# NOTE: For developer/machine-specific local properties, use build.local.properties instead (git-ignored).
#
# Possible keys and defaults (other than the common ones documented below) are found throughout 
# the root build.xml and some in component build.xml files.
# NOTE: Component build.xml files do not automatically receive (inherit) all the properties
#     defined here; only the ones listed in the "ofbiz.subbuild.props.pass" propertyset in
#     root build.xml will get passed to components (this may behave differently from
#     command line -Dkey=value property passing).
#
# Keep in mind, in Apache Ant, properties cannot be overridden, so the first one
# defined is the one that takes effect; so command-line -Dkey=value properties
# and build.local.properties entries have priority over the ones in this file.
