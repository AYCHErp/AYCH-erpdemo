# SCIPIO: if set to Y, the ports and hosts above have priority over the information in the current request when building links.
# Otherwise, they are only used as defaults/fallbacks, if request values not present/applicable.
# Default: N (current request values have priority)
# NOTE: the scipio default ("N") is different from the implicit stock Ofbiz default ("Y").
# NOTE: this does not control values from WebSite entity; currently WebSite entity always override values above AND from request.

# If you want to use HTTP then set no.http=N. Else all requests will use HTTPS except if put in the http.request-map.list  
# SCIPIO: 2018-07-09: We do NOT force HTTPS using no.http=Y, because it makes the controller definitions confusing and rigid.
# INSTEAD, we have changed the default controller request-map security https to https="true", and adjusted existing requests.
# It is easy to find out which controller requests are plain http with a simple search for https="false" in "*controller*.xml".
# NOTE: The http.request-map.list below is ignored in Scipio by default! It only takes effect if you set no.http=Y

# SCIPIO: URL path prefix appended between the domain/port and the webapp context path in generated links, 
# for webapp and navigation links (@ofbizUrl). It must start with a slash but end with no slash.
# You can also specify the name of an HTTP header from which to read the prefixes, which can be set by frontend 
# load balancers (nginx, apache, etc.); this header gets priority over webapp.url.path.prefix by default (unless override.request.host.port set above).
# This can be overridden using WebSite.webappPathPrefix entity field, which has top priority over the ones here. (added 2018-07-27)

# SCIPIO: Controls globally how the URL path prefix is added. Values:
# * true: Include the prefix when building the raw URLs - before URL rewriting is applied (pre-encoding).
#         WARN: This requires very special handling in urlrewrite.xml outbound-rules and introduces limitations.
# * false: The prefix is not added using link-building utilities;
#          it is fully left up to urlrewrite.xml files to add it using outbound-rules (post-encoding).
# This can be set per-webapp in web.xml via context-param "urlWebappPathPrefixUrlBuild" (not in WebSite entity).
