A set of HTML templating macros, part of standard Scipio Freemarker API - master include.
Automatically included at all times, unless overridden by properties or themes.
Intended to be swappable.
Includes all other default Scipio standard markup macros.        </p>
        <p>
Alongside this master include exists a global variables and styles definition file,
<code>htmlVariables.groovy</code>, which defines global styles used by most macros and utilities
(currently has no HTML documentation - mostly relevant to theme writers - see source).        </p>

            <strong>IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: </strong>
  <ul>
      <li>
        <span>
Macros should almost never use &quot;request&quot; object directly - use setRequestVar/getRequestVar/other.        </span>

        <h4>Macro Interfaces</h4>
        <p>
Scipio standard macros have versatile interfaces. There are template-facing macros (most of which support
an advanced arguments interface) and a separate set of delegated macros for theme implementation (markup macros).        </p>
        <p>
<strong>General remarks:</strong>
        </p>
        <div>  <ul>
      <li>
        <span>
All macros expect to be invoked using named parameters only (always <code>&lt;@row class=&quot;my-class&quot;&gt;</code>, never <code>&lt;@row &quot;my-class&quot;&gt;</code>)        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
Functions in Freemarker only support positional arguments, but some Scipio functions support
an &quot;args&quot; argument as a map, which emulates named arguments. This is also done
as part of the advanced args interface (documented below).        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
Many macros have advanced, low-level open/close controls for esoteric structure control where the macro
markup open and close tags and logic needs to be split or skipped. Generally their defaults are true; must specify
        </span>
<pre>&lt;@macroname open=true close=false /&gt;</pre>        <span>
for open-only and
        </span>
<pre>&lt;@macroname close=true open=false /&gt;</pre>        <span>
for close-only.
Use of these in templates is discouraged but occasionally forcefully needed.        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
Patterns described here are often workarounds for limitations in the FTL language.        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
The advanced args pattern described below is primarily designed to be simple to use from templates, almost
indistinguishable from regular macro calls, but more powerful.
It also provides more power for theme overrides; however, theme overrides must be careful in their use of it;
it&#39;s better for themes to use simple markup overrides instead, which do not use the advanced pattern.        </span>
      </li>
  </ul>
</div>
        <p>
<strong>Template-facing macros (advanced args pattern):</strong>
        </p>
        <div>  <ul>
      <li>
        <span>
These macros such as <a href="../standard/htmlForm.html#entry-field">@field</a>, <a href="../standard/htmlStructure.html#entry-row">@row</a>, <a href="../standard/htmlContent.html#entry-heading">@heading</a>, etc. are meant to be
used in templates and can also be overridden directly by themes (though not preferred method).
Most of these use a versatile args pattern that looks like:
        </span>
<pre>&lt;#macro macroname args={} inlineArgs...&gt;</pre>      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
When called from templates, these macros accept regular inlined parameters as well as a map of parameters
using the args map parameter. Intuitively, inline args have priority over args passed in the args map and in most cases simply override them.
This pattern is especially needed for themes to override the templating-facing macros cleanly and to provide a way
for template code to pass map content as arguments (not supported by Freemarker). It can be exploited
in a large number of ways (pass maps from groovy, callback macros, simplifying repeat calls, etc.) otherwise not possible.
Some non-template-facing macros also use this pattern, and some functions partly use it as well (but
Freemarker functions do not support named parameters at this time, so only partial pattern).
Some macros with this pattern also accept additional arbitrary inlined parameters to be used as extra HTML attributes (that can be passed
both in args map or inlineArgs, but usually it&#39;s used to emulate HTML with macros, thus inlineArgs);
these are not declared in the default argument lists; see individual macro documentation;
they are equivalent in usage to regular FTL interface macros that take extra attrbs as varargs
e.g.
        </span>
<pre>&lt;#macro myhtmlmacro (...) inlineAttribs...&gt;</pre>          <div class="lib-text-note">
            <strong>IMPL NOTE: </strong>
Extra attributions are handled by a system that records args names in a &quot;allArgNames&quot; member in
the args map through the mergeArgMaps function. See mergeArgMaps function in utilities library for more details.          </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
Interface:
        </span>
<pre>&lt;#assign name_defaultArgs = { (...), &quot;passArgs&quot;:{} }&gt;
&lt;#macro macroname args={} inlineArgs...&gt;</pre>        <div>  <ul>
      <li>
        <span>
<code>args</code>: Macro args map. Map of parameters to pass to the macro. It can be a bean-wrapped map (from groovy/widgets) or simple FTL hash.
        </span>
          <div class="lib-text-note">
            <strong>IMPL NOTE: </strong>
The implementation should pass this to mergeArgMaps or equivalent function (see examples).          </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
<code>inlineArgs...</code>: Macro inline args. Map of parameters passed inline to the macro via usual macro call syntax.
these have priority over args and generally will replace entries in the args map, with rare exceptions where noted.
        </span>
          <div class="lib-text-note">
            <strong>IMPL NOTE: </strong>
The implementation should pass this to mergeArgMaps or equivalent function (see examples).          </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
<code>passArgs</code>: Pass-through args. Map of args that should be passed along the major calls made by this macro or in other words
passed through the whole call stack. It allows arguments to pass through from the templating-facing macro
to the internal implementations such as markup macros, similar to a context. This is needed especially to allow theme overrides
to communicate with their markup macros without the use of globals, but it may be used for any other purpose.
Be careful about using sufficiently unique names.
        </span>
          <div class="lib-text-note">
            <strong>IMPL NOTE: </strong>
Overriding macros should avoid overriding this map;
always add new members to it instead. e.g.          </div>
<pre>&lt;@somemacro passArgs=(passArgs + {&quot;myParam&quot;:&quot;myValue&quot;)&gt;</pre>      </li>
  </ul>
</div>
      </li>
  </ul>
</div>
        <p>
<strong>Value escaping/encoding</strong> (2016-10-05)        </p>
        <p>
Macros now generally implement html escaping, javascript string value escaping, and other escaping
for strings at point-of-use in their markup implementations, across the board. Callers can expect that string
parameters will be escaped for HTML by macros and, when, applicable, determinable and possible by the macro, javascript.
This does <em>not</em> apply to nested content which receives no extra escaping (usually nested content escaping is handled by screen auto-escaping,
or templates can perform manually), nor to parameters that contain whole blocks of javascript code (read below).
        </p>
        <div>  <ul>
      <li>
        <span>
Values affected by screen context variable auto-escaping (from stock Ofbiz) can be passed as-is to macros, and the
macros will prevent double-escaping automatically.
So the following (majority of cases) is okay (where <code>screenVar1</code> came from a groovy script or screen field assignment):
        </span>
<pre>&lt;@somemacro value=screenVar1/&gt;</pre>        <span>
<em>However</em>, if a screen context variable is composed or coerced to string before being passed to the macro, such as
        </span>
<pre>&lt;@somemacro value=&quot;${screenVar1}: ${screenVar2}&quot;/&gt;
&lt;@somemacro value=screenVar1?string/&gt;</pre>        <span>
then double-escaping will occur because the coercion causes escaping to happen before the macro receives the value.
The caller must prevent this using <a href="../utilities.html#entry-rawString">#rawString</a> or equivalent:
        </span>
<pre>&lt;@somemacro value=&quot;${rawString(screenVar1)}: ${rawString(screenVar2)}&quot;/&gt;
&lt;@somemacro value=rawString(screenVar1)?string/&gt; &lt;#- this is completely redundant; for demonstration only -&gt;</pre>        <span>
Note that none of these constructs will allow passing html markup; it is all escaped even with #rawString.        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
If the caller absolutely needs to pass preformed HTML, then <a href="../utilities.html#entry-wrapAsRaw">#wrapAsRaw</a> can be used:
        </span>
<pre>&lt;@somemacro value=wrapAsRaw(&quot;&lt;strong&gt;${screenVar1}&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;${screenVar2}&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, &#39;html&#39;)/&gt;</pre>        <span>
However, this limits the macro by force-feeding it HTML markup. A better way is to specify <em>both</em> raw and html
so that the macro can select the most appropriate variant as needed, which future-proofs it:
        </span>
<pre>&lt;@somemacro value=wrapAsRaw({
  &quot;html&quot;: &quot;&lt;strong&gt;${screenVar1}&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;${screenVar2}&lt;/em&gt;&quot;,
  &quot;raw&quot;: &quot;${rawString(screenVar1)}: ${rawString(screenVar2)}&quot;
})/&gt;</pre>          <div class="lib-text-note">
            <strong>NOTE: </strong>
Using #rawString alone is simpler and so preferable to #wrapAsRaw when possible (no markup needed), but both will be safe as long
as #wrapAsRaw specifies the language(s) escaped. When #wrapAsRaw contains a &quot;raw&quot; alternative, it is as good
as #rawString; but omitting &quot;raw&quot; can hurt the future compatibility of templates with macros.          </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
<code>attribs/inlineAttribs</code>: Macros that accept extra arbitrary attribs will automatically escape the values for HTML.
<em>However</em>, if the attribs contain any javascript, the macros cannot be aware of this, and the caller must escape the javascript.
        </span>
<pre>&lt;@somemacro attribs={&quot;somejsattrib&quot;: &quot;javascript:someFunction(&#39;${escapePart(screenVar1, &#39;js&#39;)}&#39;);&quot;}/&gt; &lt;#- (recommended) -&gt;
&lt;@somemacro attribs={&quot;somejsattrib&quot;: &quot;javascript:someFunction(&#39;${rawString(screenVar1)?js_string}&#39;);&quot;}/&gt; &lt;#- (also works, but not recommended) -&gt;</pre>      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
Note that escaping javascript typically means escaping the values inserted as string literals, and never the whole javascript attribute.
Arbitrary javascript code cannot be escaped; only strings and things within string literals.
Therefore, macros which accept entire pieces of javascript code cannot escape it and
the caller is responsible for escaping the strings inserted within it (using <a href="../utilities.html#entry-escapePart">#escapePart</a> or <code>?js_string</code>).        </span>
      </li>
  </ul>
</div>
        <p>
<strong>Markup macros (theme overrides):</strong>
        </p>
        <div>  <ul>
      <li>
        <span>
These macros such as @row_markup, @heading_markup, etc. containing
the &quot;_markup&quot; name are overridable by themes to provide alternative HTML and sometimes javascript markup.
This is the simplest and preferred way to provide alternate markup.
They do not have a versatile interface like the template-facing macros and are intentionally kept
simple.
        </span>
        <div>  <ul>
      <li>
        <span>
Nevertheless, they have some requirements: these macros should always end their parameter list with
a varargs catch-all parameter &quot;catchArgs...&quot; so that future changes do not backwards break compability
with themes.        </span>
      </li>
  </ul>
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
Interface:
        </span>
<pre>&lt;#macro macroname_markup (...) origArgs={} passArgs={} catchArgs...&gt;</pre>        <div>  <ul>
      <li>
        <span>
<code>origArgs</code>: Original caller&#39;s args. map of complex parameters usually roughly as they were received by the calling macro. Rarely-used and should be
avoided in favor of the other simpler macro arguments passed by the caller, which are usually very similar. Is
needed in rare cases where the simpler macro arguments are too simplistic or don&#39;t provide all the information needed.
        </span>
          <div class="lib-text-note">
            <strong>NOTE: </strong>
In general orig args do not come from a template-facing macro but from an intermediate macro
(such as @fieldset_core or @field_input_widget). This is the intention, as the former would break
abstraction too much. In many cases however, the calling macro may happen to be
a template-facing macro. Do not rely on this while using origArgs.          </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
<code>passArgs</code>: Pass-through args. Map of args that are passed through from the template-facing macro to the parent/caller macro to
this macro or in other words passed through the whole call stack, similar to a context. This is needed especially to allow theme overrides
to communicate with their markup macros without the use of globals, but it may be used for any other purpose.
Be careful about using sufficiently unique names.        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
<code>catchArgs</code>: Catch-all args. Simply catches all the parameters the macro doesn&#39;t need to handle
        </span>
          <div class="lib-text-note">
            <strong>NOTE: </strong>
The previous parameters may be omitted and caught with catchArgs if unused.          </div>
